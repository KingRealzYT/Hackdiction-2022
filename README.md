# Hackadiction 2022 Submission: Contra

## What is Contra?
Contra is a game that isn't really what it seems. More hearts is death while no hearts' means full lives. Everything is different than it normally is!

## Who made Contra?
Contra is made by Me, and my 2 teammates/friends.

## Where can I play Contra?
Contra will be available to download right here on GitHub for Windows and Mac.
You can also compile and run it yourself!
If you're compiling this on your own, you must install CMU Graphics. [Get CMU Graphics here!](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop) (If you download from github, it does **not** require you to download CMU Graphics)
